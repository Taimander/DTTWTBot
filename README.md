If your display is different, you will need to change some numbers on the code, they are commented so you should be able to add the values easily.

There is no fail-safe or quit button, if you don't have a black desktop, you can Win+D. If you have, then you can Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open task manager, it should stop the mouse from moving.
